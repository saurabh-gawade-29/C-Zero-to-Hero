Write a program that adds the BCD contents of a block of memory. Block length in hex not exceeding 63H (9910) is stored at ……………………… and starting address of block is ……………..
Store the BCD sum as result starting from memory location ……………….

ANS:
Certainly! Below is a simple example of a program in assembly language that adds the BCD contents of a block of memory. 
Please note that the exact instructions and syntax may vary depending on the specific assembly language you are using. 
I'll provide a generic example in x86 assembly language.


PRAC ANS: 

ORG 2000H ; Assuming the program starts at memory address 2000H

MOV C, #0 ; Initialize the carry flag
MOV H, #30H ; Initialize the source address (block start)
MOV L, #00H ; Initialize the destination address (result start)

ADD_LOOP:
    MOV A, M ; Load a BCD byte from the source address # 3000H
    DAA ; Adjust for BCD addition    # BCD Addition 
    ADD C ; Add the carry (if any) # Carry => Lower nibbble or Higher nibble 
    MOV M, A ; Store the result to the destination address #Data Store into HL Pair

    INX H ; Move to the next byte in the source   
    INX L ; Move to the next byte in the destination

    MOV A, L ; Load the low byte of the destination address
    CPI #63H ; Compare with the block length
    JZ END_PROGRAM ; If block length is reached, end the program

    MOV A, H ; Load the high byte of the destination address
    CPI #31H ; Compare with the result start address
    JZ END_PROGRAM ; If result start address is reached, end the program

    JMP ADD_LOOP ; Repeat the loop

END_PROGRAM:
HLT ; Halt the program

; Additional Data Section
; Define a block of BCD data starting at memory address 3000H (block start)
ORG 3000H
DB 01H, 02H, 03H, 04H, 05H, 06H, 07H, 08H, 09H, 0AH, 0BH, 0CH

let's break down the provided assembly code:

ORG 2000H: This directive sets the origin (starting address) of the program to memory address 2000H.

MOV C, #0: This initializes the carry flag to 0.

MOV H, #30H: This initializes the H register to 30H, which represents the high byte of the memory address where the block of data to be added starts.

MOV L, #00H: This initializes the L register to 00H, which represents the low byte of the memory address where the result will be stored.

ADD_LOOP:: This is a label marking the beginning of a loop where the BCD addition operation will take place.

MOV A, M: This loads the accumulator (A) with the value from the memory location pointed to by the HL register pair.

DAA: This instruction adjusts the contents of the accumulator after addition to ensure it remains in BCD format.

ADD C: This instruction adds the value of the carry flag to the accumulator.

MOV M, A: This stores the result back into the memory location pointed to by the HL register pair.

INX H and INX L: These instructions increment the HL register pair, effectively moving to the next byte in both the source (block of data) and destination (result) memory areas.

MOV A, L and CPI #63H: These instructions compare the low byte of the destination address (result start address) with 63H (99 in decimal), which represents the maximum block length.

MOV A, H and CPI #31H: These instructions compare the high byte of the destination address with 31H (49 in decimal), which represents the starting address of the result storage area.

JZ END_PROGRAM: These conditional jump instructions jump to the END_PROGRAM label if the comparisons in steps 11 and 12 result in equality.

JMP ADD_LOOP: This unconditional jump instruction jumps back to the ADD_LOOP label to repeat the addition process for the next byte in the block of data.

END_PROGRAM:: This is a label marking the end of the program.

HLT: This instruction halts the execution of the program.

ORG 3000H: This directive sets the origin (starting address) of the data section to memory address 3000H.

DB 01H, 02H, 03H, ...: These are data bytes representing the block of BCD data to be added. They are stored consecutively starting from memory address 3000H.

Overall, this program loops through each byte in the block of BCD data, adds it to the result while considering the carry from the previous addition, and stores the result back in memory. It continues this process until the entire block is processed.
